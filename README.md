This is a very simple script for zsh (I may add somme support for bash
and sh later)

In order to use it you need:
    -ImageMagick 6.7.6-9 2012-05-12 Q16 (Not tested with earlier verisons)
    -zsh shell with 256 colors ($TERM=xterm-256color)

If you have any idea of implementing a version working in bash
or sh, I will really like to hear you!
