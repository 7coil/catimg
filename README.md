This is a very simple script for zsh (I may add somme support for bash and sh later)

Dependencies
------------
In order to use it you need:

* ImageMagick 6.6.0-4 2012-08-17 Q16 (Not tested with earlier verisons)
* zsh shell with 256 colors support

If you have any idea of implementing a version working in bash or sh, I will really like to hear you!
